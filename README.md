# The change in marriage and divorce rates due to the pandemic in Turkey
## Part A: Introduction:
*Along with the restrictions imposed due to the Covid 19 virus, which affected the whole world, significant differences occurred between the marriage and divorce statistics of people for various reasons. 
Marriage and divorce statistics for the years 2019-2020 were used to compare these differences with the graphs..
In this research, we will cover the following under the title of 2019 - 2020 marriage and divorce statistics;*

* Number of couples married in 2019 - 2020,
* The number of couples divorced between 2019 and 2020,
* Number of marriages by months (2019, 2020),
* Number of divorces by months (2019, 2020),
* 10 provinces with the highest and lowest crude marriage rate, (2020)
* 10 provinces with the highest and lowest crude divorce rates, (2020)

## Identify the problem:
*The family is one of the leading social institutions that emerged within the framework of certain common goals and interests. The existence and continuity of the family institution is provided through marriage. However, as a result of disagreements that occur from time to time, these marriages end in divorce.
In our country, statistics are kept every year and the reasons for the change in statistics are investigated. However, these changes (decreases) in the last few years are attributed to the current pandemic.*

## The Story Of Problem:
*The story of my problem is the effect of the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic on the marriage and divorce rates of couples. Let's take an example of the problem, couples who want to get married cannot get a wedding day due to restrictions, want to do their wedding without any restrictions, simply not wanting to wear a mask at their wedding, are among the reasons for the decrease in marriage rates in 2020 compared to 2019.
If we talk about divorce, the couples thinking that they can't manage this marriage by spending more time with each other due to restrictions and the negative effects of the pandemic on human psychology and health are among the reasons for divorce, but people cannot find the opportunity because the cases are postponed due to restrictions.
As a result, in this study, we will discuss the change in marriage and divorce rates in Turkey due to the pandemic.*
