I will get the data from ;
https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr  
https://covid19asi.saglik.gov.tr/ 
and related news sites.

The data I need;
Total number of vaccines supplied,
Population in the provinces,
Age range of vaccination (priority),
Also Number of People Administered 1st and 2nd Doses

The problems I may experience are related to the accuracy of the data. 
For example, does everybody get their vaccine, does the amount supposed to be supplied reach the country?
