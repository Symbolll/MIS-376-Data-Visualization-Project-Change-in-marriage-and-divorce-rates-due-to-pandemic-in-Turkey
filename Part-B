I will get the data from ;
https://data.tuik.gov.tr/
https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Evlenme-ve-Bosanma-Istatistikleri-2020-37211
https://tuikweb.tuik.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=33708
and related news sites.

The data I need;
How many people got married in 2019 and 2020,
How many people were divorced in 2019 and 2020.


The problems I may experience are related to the accuracy of the data.
